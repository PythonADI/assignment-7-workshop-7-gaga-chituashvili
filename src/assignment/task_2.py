"""
Write a function called outer_function that defines a local variable message = "Hello". Inside it, define another function called inner_function that tries to access and modify message. Call inner_function within outer_function and see if the changes persist.

- What happens if you use the nonlocal keyword with message inside inner_function?
- Can inner_function modify message without nonlocal?
