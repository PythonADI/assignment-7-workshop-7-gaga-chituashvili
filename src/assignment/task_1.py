"""
Create a function called `increase_counter` that increases a `counter` variable by 1 each time it's called. Try initializing `counter` = 0 outside the function (global scope), and then call `increase_counter` multiple times.

- What happens when you try to update counter inside the function without using global?
- Now, try declaring counter as global inside the function and observe the results.
